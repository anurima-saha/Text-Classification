# Text-Classification
Wine reviews used to determine the type of wine training on imbalanced data using classification algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier. Neural Network (CNN, RNN and LSTM)  and LLM models (DistilBERT and RoBERTa) were also used followed by error analysis using SHAP.
